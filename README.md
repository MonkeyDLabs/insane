# Insane

Insane is a compact yet highly modular framework designed for individual use. Inspired by [loco.rs](https://loco.rs), it takes a distinct approach to framework architecture. The primary goal is to offer a user-friendly experience while providing ample room for extension and customization. Originally derived from [loco.rs](https://loco.rs), this project has undergone significant modifications to suit a unique vision.

## Early Phase Development

Please note that Insane is currently in its early phase of development. It is primarily intended for internal needs and may undergo rapid changes as it evolves. Feedback and contributions are welcome as we work towards refining and expanding its capabilities.
